        <p style="color:white;">  When Will comes back, nothing is back to normal. His mother,
          Joyce Byers, gets over protetive making it harder to feel comfortable. His
          friends Mike, Lucas, and Gaten begin to change as well.
          Mike is upset missing Eleven while Lucas and Gaten fight for the new girl named Max.
          Max's older step brother, Billy, competes with Steve, who gets broken hearted
          when Nancy choses Jonathan instead. We soon discover that Hopper lives with
          Eleven to hide and protect her. Eleven misses Mike and decides to finds her way
          out. Her actions leads to more discoveries about her life, mother, and

        <p style="color:white;"> Leaving their life drama aside, Gaten finds a monster that Will believes to have
          spitted out in Season 1. There is not only one monster living but THOUSANDS!
          When terrigying visions and creepy events from Will, he gets possesed by the leader
          of the demogorgons after being told by Bob (boyfriend of Joyce) to face his fear and scare it away.
          Of course it was horrible advice. With more trouble to go, Will's friends and family fight off the beast
          in him while Eleven returns to save the town of Hawkins Indiana. Season 2 had blown everyone away
        making us wonder about the third one! Many believe to have good predictions, what are yours? </p></center>
